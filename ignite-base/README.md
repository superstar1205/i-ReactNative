#  React Native Ignite Base App
[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com/) [![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/ir/ignite/branches/master/shields_badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/ir/react_native_base)

_The ideal starting app for React Native:_
* Standard Compliant
* Multiple Platform Support
* Documented structure
* Redux State Management
* Redux persistence (uses AsyncStorage via [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist))
* Sagas Redux Daemons
* Githooks
* AVA Tests
* Networking Code
* Common Libs:
  * [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
  * [react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable)
  * [react-native-i18n](https://github.com/AlexanderZaytsev/react-native-i18n)
  * [react-native-drawer](https://github.com/root-two/react-native-drawer)

## iOS/Android/XDE support
Code is geared towards tested and cross platform functionality. [XDE](https://exponentjs.com/) is disabled by default, but see `index.js` for enabling.

## :no_entry_sign: Standard Compliant

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)
This project adheres to Standard.  Our CI enforces this, so we suggest you enable linting to keep your project compliant during development.

**To Lint on Commit**

1. Install git-hooks => On a Mac `brew install git-hooks` - [Other](https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks/)
2. Setup on Repo => `git hooks --install`

**Bypass Lint**

If you have to bypass lint for a special commit that you will come back and clean (pushing something to a branch etc.) then you can bypass git hooks with adding `--no-verify` to your commit command.

**Understanding Linting Errors**

The linting rules are from JS Standard and React-Standard.  [Regular JS errors can be found with descriptions here](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/), while [React errors and descriptions can be found here](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react).

## :us: Internationalization (i18n)
Translations are kept in the [I18n.js](https://github.com/infinitered/react_native_base/blob/master/App/I18n/I18n.js) file.  Edit this file for strings.  Even if your app doesn't support multi-languge, this is one of the best ways to keep strings uniform, and typos in check throughout an application.
