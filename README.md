## :arrow_up: How to Setup

*Install*

`npm install -g react-native-ignite`

*Use*

`ignite new MyApplication`

## :arrow_forward: How to Run App

1. cd to the repo
2. Run Build for either OS
  * for iOS
    * run `react-native run-ios`
  * for Android
    * Run Genymotion
    * run `react-native run-android`

## :iphone: iOS/Android/XDE support

## :no_entry_sign: About Standard Compliance

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)
This project adheres to Standard.  Our CI enforces this, so we suggest you enable linting to keep your project compliant during development.

**To Lint on Commit**

1. Install git-hooks => On a Mac `brew install git-hooks` - [Other](https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks/)
2. Setup on Repo => `git hooks --install`

## :us: Internationalization (i18n)
Translations are kept in the [I18n.js](https://github.com/infinitered/react_native_base/blob/master/App/I18n/I18n.js) file.  Edit this file for strings.  Even if your app doesn't support multi-languge, this is one of the best ways to keep strings uniform, and typos in check throughout an application.
