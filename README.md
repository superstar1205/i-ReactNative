# Ignite CLI

<p align="center">
  :fire: The hottest CLI for React Native: boilerplates, plugins, generators, and more. :fire:
  <br/>
</p>

<img width="794" alt="screen shot 2018-12-14 at 9 20 31 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1479215/50017668-a04c0200-ff81-11e8-9b61-a1ae28363798.png">

### Why Ignite CLI?

- **Easily spin up a new React Native app** with best practices built-in
- **No runtime!** This is a developer tool only, not a library you have to depend on and figure out how to upgrade
- **An ever-expanding list of [boilerplates](./BOILERPLATES.md) and [plugins](./PLUGINS.md)** to jump-start your app
- **An amazing [community](http://community.infinite.red)** of other Ignite / React Native developers when you need help
- **Battle tested** and used every day by the developers at Infinite Red and thousands of developers around the world
- **Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux** because not all React Native developers are on one platform
- **Saves an average of two weeks** on your React Native development

And you also get (by default) all of the sweet, sweet goodness of [our default boilerplate, Bowser](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser), or choose [one of many others](./BOILERPLATES.md).

> Ignite saved me a few weeks (if not months) getting started with React Native.

## :arrow_down: Install

First, make sure you're set up for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content)

then...

Make sure you have a reasonably recent version of Node (7.6+ minimum). You can check your version of node by running

```
node -v
```

then...

Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for your system.

finally...

```
$ yarn global add ignite-cli
$ ignite new MyNewAppName
```

## Quick Example

Infinite Red provides two primary boilerplates; they are:

- **Andross** - the tried and true (React Navigation, Redux, & Redux Saga)
- **Bowser** - the latest and greatest (React Navigation, MobX State Tree, & TypeScript). [Why MST over redux?](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser#why-this-stack)

### Use Ignite Bowser: [Infinite Red Bowser boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser)

Watch Jamon Holmgren's talk at React Live Amsterdam where he uses Ignite Bowser to build an app in less than 30 minutes:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb8MWkQ9GOc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb8MWkQ9GOc)

```
$ yarn global add ignite-cli
$ ignite new PizzaApp
  ( Choose `Bowser` when prompted )
$ cd PizzaApp
$ ignite generate screen pizza-location-list
  ( Choose `example` domain when prompted. This determines where your new screen will go in the directory structure. )
$ ignite generate component pizza-location
  ( Choose `example` domain when prompted. This determines where your new screen will go in the directory structure. )
$ ignite --help
```

### Use Ignite Andross [Infinite Red Andross boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-andross)

```
$ yarn global add ignite-cli
$ ignite new PizzaApp
  ( Choose Andross when prompted )
$ cd PizzaApp
$ ignite add maps
$ ignite add vector-icons
$ ignite generate screen PizzaLocationList
$ ignite generate component PizzaLocation
$ ignite generate map StoreLocator
$ ignite add i18n
$ ignite remove i18n
$ ignite --help
```
