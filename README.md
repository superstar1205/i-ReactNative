### Ignite 2 is here!

After months of work and sweat and tears, Ignite 2 (beta) has landed! We're incredibly proud of where Ignite 2 is and where it's headed.

Cliff notes version of the difference between Ignite 1 and 2:

Ignite 1 was a (very nice!) [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) boilerplate. Ignite 2 is a CLI and generator for React Native with boilerplates, plugins, and more. Where before you had one choice -- [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red)'s boilerplate -- now you can choose from many boilerplates and also add standalone plugins as you need them. It's much more modular and extensible than Ignite 1.

If you really liked Ignite 1 as it was, then not much has changed! You just run `ignite new MyApp --max` and everything feels pretty normal from there.


### Quick Example

```
$ npm install -g ignite-cli
$ ignite new PizzaApp
$ cd PizzaApp
$ ignite add maps
$ ignite add vector-icons
$ ignite generate screen PizzaLocationList
$ ignite generate component PizzaLocation
$ ignite generate map StoreLocator
$ ignite add i18n
$ ignite remove i18n
$ ignite i love you
```

### Why Ignite?

* Easily spin up a new React Native app with best practices built-in
* No runtime! This is a developer tool only, not a library you have to depend on
* An ever-expanding list of boilerplates and plugins
* Powerful but well-defined behavior
* Battle tested and used every day by the developers at Infinite Red

And you also get (by default) all of the sweet, sweet goodness of our default boilerplate:

* Works with iOS and Android out of the box
* Useful generators, including components, screens, styles, and more
* API-ready -- hook it up and start talking to your server
* Standard-js compliant code
* Redux and redux-sagas state management
* Well-documented code
* Gorgeous Ava tests
* and much, much more... [go check out the readme](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-ir-boilerplate-2016) (WIP during alpha)

## :arrow_down: Install

First, make sure you're set up for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content)

then...

Make sure you have Node 7.6+

While you are free to use whichever node version manager you like, we like using [n](https://github.com/tj/n)

If you currently use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and would like to switch, follow [these steps](./docs/quick-start/nvm-to-n.md)

You can check your version of node by running

```
node -v
```

then install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for your system

finally...

_All global installs below are using npm over yarn because of [this bug](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/859) on Windows._
```
$ npm install -g ignite-cli
$ ignite new MyNewAppName
```
