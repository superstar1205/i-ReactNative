## :arrow_up: Built-In Generators

#### Generate an app: `ignite new MyApplication`
* The application generator uses the `ignite-base` template to provide a fresh application with all the common tech wired up and ready to roll.  Base applications come with common development screens, tools, and components.  _As for now, this is a 'Kitchen Sink' plan of attack.  Eventually to be pared down, and adjustable in v2.0_

#### Generate a component: `ignite generate component SmoothButton`
* The component generator creates a new 'dumb component' with the stylesheet.  Both files are created and placed in their appropriate folders.

#### Generate a container: `ignite generate container SubMenu`
* A generated container is a smart component that is connected to Redux.  Usually for containing other components.  The component and stylesheet are placed in the `Containers` folder.

#### Generate a screen: `ignite generate screen Settings`
* A generated screen is an opinionated container with a generated route.  Keyboard avoiding and other base code is placed in this connected smart component.

#### Generate a listview: `ignite generate listview HotDates`
* React Native listview container with easy step-by-step instructions on how to get started with an easy list template.

#### COMING BACK SOON (broken in latest maps) - Generate a mapview: `ignite generate mapview MapScreen`
* react-native-maps container, component, and map helpers with easy step-by-step instructions on how to get started with an simple map screen.

#### Import images: `ignite import imagesfile`
* Imports all files in `Images` folder and converts the names into **key: value** pairs in the _image_ object inside of the `Images.js` file in the `Themes` folder.
