# Ignite CLI

<p align="center">
  :fire: The hottest CLI for React Native, boilerplates, plugins, generators, and more. :fire:
  <br/>
</p>

_Note: if you're coming to [Chain React, the React Native Conference](https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf) in Portland July 11-13, we'll be handing out Ignite stickers! Be sure to say hi to an Infinite Red employee there._


## Ignite CLI is here!

After months of work and sweat and tears, Ignite CLI has landed! We're incredibly proud of where Ignite CLI is and where it's headed.

Cliff notes version of the difference between Ignite 1 and Ignite CLI:

Ignite 1 was a (very nice!) [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) boilerplate. Ignite CLI is a generator for React Native with boilerplates, plugins, and more. Where before you had one choice -- [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red)'s boilerplate -- now you can choose from many boilerplates and also add standalone plugins as you need them. It's much more modular and extensible than Ignite 1.

If you really liked Ignite 1 as it was, then not much has changed! You just run `ignite new MyApp --max` and everything feels pretty normal from there.


### Why Ignite CLI?

* Easily spin up a new React Native app with best practices built-in
* No runtime! This is a developer tool only, not a library you have to depend on
* An ever-expanding list of [boilerplates](./BOILERPLATES.md) and [plugins](./PLUGINS.md)
* Powerful but well-defined behavior
* Battle tested and used every day by the developers at Infinite Red

And you also get (by default) all of the sweet, sweet goodness of [our default boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-ir-boilerplate), or choose [one of many others](./BOILERPLATES.md).


## :arrow_down: Install

First, make sure you're set up for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content)

then...

Make sure you have Node 7.6+

**Note**: _July 2017_  Users of Node 8.0+ should beware of issues with debugging. V8 uses the `inspector` protocol and no longer allows `--debug` and `--debug-brk`. But `inspector` does not run well with Chrome debugger (and probably also not with VS Code debugger and node-inspector). Breakpoints are not hit, or debugger doesn't disconnect. So inform yourself well before going this route. See https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7593 (and many related issues) for more info.

While you are free to use whichever node version manager you like, we like using [n](https://github.com/tj/n)

If you currently use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and would like to switch, follow [these steps](./docs/quick-start/nvm-to-n.md)

You can check your version of node by running

```
node -v
```

then install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for your system

finally...

_All global installs below are using npm over yarn because of [this bug](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/859) on Windows._
```
$ npm install -g ignite-cli
$ ignite new MyNewAppName
```


## Quick Example

Infinite Red provides two boilerplates, they are:
* Andross - the tried and true (React Navigation, Redux, & Redux Saga)
* Bowser - the latest and greatest (React Navigation, MobX State Tree, & TypeScript)

### Use Ignite Bowser: [Infinite Red Bowser boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-ir-boilerplate-bowser)

```
$ npm install -g ignite-cli
$ ignite new PizzaApp
  ( Choose `Bowser` when prompted )
$ cd PizzaApp
$ ignite generate screen pizza-location-list
  ( Choose `example` domain when prompted. This determines where your new screen will go in the directory structure. )
$ ignite generate component pizza-location
  ( Choose `example` domain when prompted. This determines where your new screen will go in the directory structure. )
$ ignite i love you
```

### Use Ignite Andross [Infinite Red Andross boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-ir-boilerplate-andross)

```
$ npm install -g ignite-cli
$ ignite new PizzaApp
  ( Choose Andross when prompted )
$ cd PizzaApp
$ ignite add maps
$ ignite add vector-icons
$ ignite generate screen PizzaLocationList
$ ignite generate component PizzaLocation
$ ignite generate map StoreLocator
$ ignite add i18n
$ ignite remove i18n
$ ignite i love you
```
