# Getting Started

#### This document will get you started using Ignite 2.0

## Dev Version

> Note: Ignite 2.0 is in alpha currently, so if you want to use it, you'll
have to follow these instructions

If you are looking to contribute to Ignite, or want to use it before the
official release, then follow these instructions. Otherwise, you can skip down
to the *Release Version* section.

We'll need node *v7.5.0*; install that if it isn't already: `nvm install v7.5.0`

Next, you'll need to clone Ignite from Github and check out the branch where
version 2 is being developed:

```
git clone git@github.com:infinitered/ignite.git
git fetch --all # to make sure your repo has a reference to the branch
git checkout -b next origin/next
```





Install node v7.5.0
git clone git@github.com:infinitered/ignite.git
git checkout -b origin next
npm run bootstrap
npm install lerna
npm install -g react-native-ignite
npm link (from packages/ignite)
brew install watchman
npm install -g react-native-cli
ignite new HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld/
react-native run-ios
```
