# Wallpaper Component

[Back to all components](./Components.md)

Ignite's `Wallpaper` component renders an image background to your component or a screen. It is composed of an [Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image) component. You can also create your own presets for the background image.

```tsx
import { Wallpaper } from "../components/Wallpaper"
export const bgImage = require("./background.png")

;<Wallpaper backgroundImage={bgImage} />
```

## Props

### `style`

The `style` optional prop is an object that overrides the default style and is used for padding and margin. It is of the type `StyleProp<ImageStyle>`. See React Native docs on [ImageStyle](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#style) for more information.

```tsx
<Wallpaper style={{ marginHorizontal: 5, paddingVertical: 10 }} />
```

### `backgroundImage`

The `backgroundImage` optional prop is an [`ImageSource`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#imagesource) that overrides the default image used for background.

```tsx
export const bgImage = require("./background.png")

;<Wallpaper backgroundImage={bgImage} />
```

### Presets

Presets allow you to have a consistent look and feel across your app without having to redefine the styles all the time.

```tsx
<Wallpaper preset="stretch" />
```

You'll want to customize these presets and add more. You can do this in the `wallpaper.presets.ts` file.

If you find yourself overriding styles with the `style` prop a lot, you probably need a new preset for that use case.

#### Available Presets

`stretch`: this scales the background image's width and height independently,

#### Custom Presets

Feel free to add your own presets by emulating the style you see with the provided presets. In a typical Infinite Red project, for Wallpaper we would have a couple or more presets that we use across the project.
