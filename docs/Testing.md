# Testing Ignite Apps

At Infinite Red, we want confidence that the code we are shipping isn't breaking the experience for our clients' users.

Our philosophy is roughly based on the following idea from Guillermo Rauch:

> Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.

This isn't a hard and fast rule, but it does express our approach fairly well.
