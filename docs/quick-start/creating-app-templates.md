# App Templates

App templates serve as a starting point for your app. You can use one when
you create a new Ignite project with the `--template` flag:

```
ignite new MyIgniteApp --template {app template name}
```

Ignite 2.0 ships with an app template called the `Infinite Red App Template`,
which is the way that we at Infinite Red prefer to set up ours.
