# Spork

The `$ ignite generate` command can be used to quickly generate components, screens etc. All outputs are created based on [Embedded JavaScript](https://github.com/tj/ejs) templates (`*.ejs` files). To modify the templates, the `$ ignite spork` command can be used.

To get started, simply use the `$ ignite spork` command. The CLI will display a list of templates available. Select those you'd like to modify and confirm your choice. The CLI will create new `*.ejs` files in the `ignite/Spork` project directory.

After editing the templates to your liking, don't forget to save them. They can be immediatelly used via the `$ ignite generate` command.
