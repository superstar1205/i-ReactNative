## Upgrading

It's important to stay up-to-date with React Native updates. To keep your React Native app updated, check out these tools:

- [React Native Upgrade Helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/) great web based tool
- [rn-diff-purge](https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge)

It's less important to keep your Ignite app updated, but you might want to keep pace with Infinite Red's latest changes. To do that, [@nirre7](https://github.com/nirre7) built an amazing tool:

- [ignite-diff-purge](https://github.com/nirre7/ignite-diff-purge) To help you see the diffs between different versions. The first diff is from 5.4.1 (ignite-bowser) and then continues with Ignite CLI boilerplate
- [ignite-expo-diff-purge](https://github.com/nirre7/ignite-expo-diff-purge) To help you see the diffs between different versions. The first diff is from 5.4.1 (ignite-bowser with Expo) and then continues with Ignite CLI boilerplate with Expo
- [ignite-bowser-diff-purge](https://github.com/nirre7/ignite-bowser-diff-purge) To help you see the diffs between different versions of the old [ignite-bowser](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser) boilerplate
