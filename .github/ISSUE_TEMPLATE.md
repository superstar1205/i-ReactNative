### Hiya! So you think it's broken or missing a feature eh?

Welllllll, it just might be.  Do me a favor and check the following.

- [ ] Issue does not already exist
- Identify exactly what aspect your issue is about
  - [ ] ignite base application
  - [ ] ignite the cli
  - [ ] ignite generated code

Also, for the quickest assistance please run `ignite doctor` and paste in
everything (including the lines with 3 backticks).
